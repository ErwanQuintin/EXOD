# EXODUS
## EPIC XMM-Newton Outburst Detector Ultimate System

The aim of this project is to provide a tool to spot variable sources in EPIC-pn XMM-Newton observations.
This is done by computing the variability of each pixel of the detector instead of generating lightcurves of individual sources. It allows to find faint transients for which the lightcurves are not generated by XMM-Newton's pipeline since they are too faint.

We encourage the potential users to read the users guide (EXOD_users_guide.pdf), and especially follow the tutorial presented in section 6.

## Tutorial

Let's set the path to where the scripts are located and where we want to store our data, for instance

```
SCRIPTS=/path/EXOD/scripts
FOLDER=/path/data
```

One can use the `run_exodus.sh` script to download, filter and compute the variability for a list of observations. Let's try, for instance, with observation 0652250701, and (see the obs_ids.txt in the examples folder):

```
bash run_exodus.sh -obs_id_file obs_ids.txt -lc_enable false -iterative_det_level false
```
The whole process should take a few minutes. An example of the output of these commands can be found in the folder `examples`.

As the render_all.py output shows, one variable source has been detected with TW=100 s, DL=8, bs=3.
